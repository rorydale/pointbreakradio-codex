# Point Break Radio Manifesto

## Origin
- Began March 2020, during lockdown, to recreate the shared ritual of DJing in bars with friends.
- Started as live streams for a few friends and family → grew into 430+ shows over 4 years.
- Each show is **two hours, live, improvised, sequenced by hand**.

## Philosophy
- **Not playlists. Shows.**
- Every broadcast is curated, intentional, and companionable.
- The music is the structure, but the show is alive: improvised intros, back-to-back tracks, real-time energy.
- This is **human radio**: no automation, no filler, made to be listened to whole.

## Tone & Voice
- **Companionable**: like hanging out with a friend who brings the right records.
- **Conversational**: playful asides, parentheses, humor, warmth.
- **Transparent**: not pushy or arrogant; proud but understated.
- **Professional but human**: simple, clean, intentional design; never sterile or corporate.
- **Spirit**: DIY, inspired by *Pump Up the Volume* and the 90s “hack the airwaves” vibe. Feels underground, without claiming illegality. Confident, rebellious, authentic.

## Archive vs. New
- The 430+ shows = **The First Wave** (a proud, living archive).
- New shows = **The Next Wave** (continuation, not reset).
- The site should showcase both: a searchable archive + a fresh relaunch.

## Design Language
- **Dark mode first**: site lives in a black/dark grey environment.
- **Neon cyberpunk palette**: pink → purple gradients, turquoise/aqua accents, glow on hover states.
- **Retro/hacker energy**: evokes pirate radio stations, DIY studios, neon 90s, vintage cyberpunk aesthetics.
- **Minimal but polished**: clean layouts, few distractions, essentials only — every interaction should feel intentional and crafted.
- **Candy in the details**: subtle animations, gradients, glow, hover effects. Nothing bloated, just enough to feel alive and special.
- **Typography**: bold, readable, modern sans-serif for clarity; secondary type can lean slightly retro for headers if balanced with legibility.
- **Analogy**: The site should feel like walking into a back-room broadcast studio lit with neon, with the polish of a boutique modern station.

## Inspirations
- Spirit of *Pump Up the Volume*: DIY, authenticity, radio as resistance.
- Aesthetic of 90s hacker/cyberpunk media: neon glow, underground vibes, edge-of-illicit.
- Professional sheen of boutique stations (NTS, dublab).
- Goal: a **clear signal in the noise** — music-first, distraction-free, but visually unforgettable.

## Promise
- Two-hour broadcasts, built by hand.
- A living archive, a fresh wave.
- Always intentional, always human.
- Visual identity: bold, neon, alive — a companion to the sound.

**Thanks for listening with me.**
